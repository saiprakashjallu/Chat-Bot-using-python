## Problem Statement
* We face a lot of software issues in our systems and do not whom to ask and how to clear the problem. This problem is almost common for almost all the ones who holds a system in their hand.


### Overview
* Solution overview- We created a dataset called yml file and are extracting from the file as per user input.
* Technologies used- python modules (chatterbot, list trainers).
* Known Bugs- as this is a fixed chatbot, the questioned should be almost exact as how we inputted in the yml file.
